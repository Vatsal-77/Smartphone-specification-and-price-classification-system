Step 4: Authentication of the Api created.
Step 5: Appropriate data was Scraped using keywords such as ("iphone", "samsung", "vivo" , "oppo") respectively.
Step 6: Tweet limits was set for finite number of data selection purpose.
Step 7: Data Scraped was append in the data frame created.
Step 8: Scraped data frame was converted and saved as a CSV file(smartphone.csv).
Step 9: The CSV file(smartphone) saved was pushed and run in the software sqlite3 to ensure that the queries satisfy the data in the scraped data frame.
Step 10: Then saved the scrapped data in google drive.
Step 11: After the data and the queries being tested on Sqlite3 the same CSV file (smartphone.csv) was used to run on google colab.
Step 12: All queries were then run on google colab as well (colab linked is also attached with the file)
Step 13: Created the ER diagram and UML diagram
Step 14: Created all the use cases for the queries
