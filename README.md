# Smartphone-specification-and-price-classification-system

Project objective:
The main purpose of the project is to create a database with respect to smart phones available in the market. The specifications mentioned in the database includes the names of the Brand, model, price, storage, resolution, dual sim availability, battery capacity and few other attributes. Since there are a vast number of smartphones available in the market, there is a possibility for the customer to be confused on what he wants to purchase. With this database which includes all the details about different mobile phones, it gets easier for the customer to choose which smartphone to buy according to his needs/requirements. Moreover, the database will also be beneficial for the corporate companies associated with the manufacturing of smartphones. The sales and marketing department of various brands can keep a track of the products in demand, accordingly the products customers show no interest in. On a global level various companies can be up to date with current market trends and hold their ground in such an altering market of the present generation. The extension of the project is detecting the price change of a specific smartphone and maintaining it in the database accordingly.
